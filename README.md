## âœ… Problem 1: Print First `a` Odd Numbers

**Description**:  
Given a single integer input `a`, print the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.

**Example**:  
- Input: `a = 4`  
- Output: `1, 3, 5, 7`

---

## âœ… Problem 2: Odd Number Series Until a = x

**Description**:  
With a single integer input `a`, generate the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.

**Example**:  
- Input: `a = 3`  
- Output: `1, 3, 5`

---

## âœ… Problem 3: Conditional Odd Series Based on Even/Odd Input

**Description**:  
With a single integer input `a`, print:
- The first `a` odd numbers if `a` is odd
- The first `a - 1` odd numbers if `a` is even

**Examples**:  
- Input: `a = 4` â†’ Output: `1, 3, 5`  
- Input: `a = 5` â†’ Output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`

## âœ… Problem 4: Count Multiples from 1 to 9 in a List

**Description**:  
Given a list of integers, count how many elements are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.

**Example Input**:  
`[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]`

**Example Output**:  
`{1=11, 2=8, 3=4, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, 7=0, 8=1, 9=1}`
